//In the provided store/index.ts file, Vuex is being set up to manage the state of the Vue.js application. Letâ€™s break down the code and its purpose:
import { createStore as createVuexStore } from "vuex";
//This is the function provided by Vuex (the state management library for Vue.js) 
//to create a new Vuex store instance. The store manages the global state of the application.
import ship from "./ship";
import books from "./books";
//ship and books: These are two Vuex modules that are imported from their respective files (./ship and ./books). 
//Modules allow you to split the store into separate, smaller stores (or modules) to manage specific parts of the app's state.
export const createStore = () => {
  return createVuexStore({
    modules: {
      ship,
      books,
    },
  });
};
//The modules object allows you to divide the store into different parts, each with its own state, mutations, actions, and getters.
//ship: Likely handles the state related to the "ship" feature in the application.
//books: Likely handles the state related to the "books" feature in the application.
